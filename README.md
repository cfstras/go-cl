# go-cl

This package provides simple wrappers around the OpenCL API.

To use this package, ensure that the headers and your favourite OpenCL
distribution is installed. On Linux, the headers are usually available in a
package like "opencl-headers", while the implementation is provided by the
graphics driver distribution. On Windows, your graphics driver distribution
should have all the necessary stuff.

There are some basic tests provided as examples, see cl_test.go.

_Note:_ This package is far from finished -- if you want to add anything, just contact me :)
